- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mauricebuettgenbach
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and science for several different fields.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis and science via python and associated libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller python projects as my job does not allow me to do more.
